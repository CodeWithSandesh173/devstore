// Import Firebase (mock or real) - simplified for browser console injection or similar context
// Since we are in the terminal, we can't easily run browser JS.
// However, the USER can run this in their console.
// Alternatively, we can try to create a node script if node is available, but auth is tricky.
// The best way for "update firebase also" is to instruct the user or provide a button in Admin.
// Wait, I can inject a script into the admin page or index page that runs once? 
// Or better, let's create a temporary HTML file that the user can open to sync.

// Wait, I can command the browser tool to open a page and run console log? 
// I don't have a browser tool active. 

// The user *asked* me to update firebase. 
// "update firebase also man"
// I will create a small utility HTML file `sync_db.html` that imports the config and runs the sync function.
// Then I will tell the user to open it, or I can try to open it if I had a browser options.

// Actually, I can just modify `js/admin.js` to add a "Sync Products" button or run it automatically once?
// No, auto-run is dangerous.
// Let's add a "Sync Products" button to the Admin Settings panel.
